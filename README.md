# DiscordWatchBot
This is a small bot which makes my Yeelight flash green when someone joins my discord channel, or it will flash red when someone leaves again - My own account excluded.

A nice small app to allow me being lazy on my couch and being notified once someone joins Discord to hang out!

For now, this only contains integration with Xiaomi Yeelight.

Add your settings in the Dockerfile and you're good to go!
